# about

Contraband is a side project that I started in order to collect pieces of
software that I'm proud of and which have a use for more people than just
myself. It let's me keep my personal account full of [dotfiles][dotfiles] and
[other important repositories][emotions] that have a limited appeal beyond my
own uses.

[dotfiles]: https://github.com/xoebus/dotfiles
[emotions]: https://github.com/xoebus/emotions

The majority of the software I write is related to the CI server
[Concourse][concourse] (which I work on with [Alex Suraci][suraci] and friends)
and [Cloud Foundry][cloudfoundry] which is my day job at [Pivotal][pivotal].

[concourse]: https://concourse.ci
[suraci]: https://github.com/vito
[cloudfoundry]: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/
[pivotal]: https://pivotal.io/
